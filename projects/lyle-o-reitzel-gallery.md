## Lyle O. Reitzel Gallery

In addition to co-managing Lyle O. Reitzel Gallery in 2018, I designed all posters, flyers and other graphical assets for the gallery's various events including openings and artist talks.

### Flyers

I designed flyers and hand-outs for all gallery openings and events at Lyle O. Reitzel Gallery, getting a chance to start a dialogue with our artists and collaborating to use their works and my typography and graphic design to enhance the exhibition experience and draw in visitors.

### The Other Gallery

In January 2019 I had the opportunity to do brand identity and assist in exhibition design for a secondary pop-up gallery, The Other Gallery. Our exhibition, "Without Permission" by Lucinda Grange opened January 21st, 2019 in the Lower East Side.
